# Running Bil

## Synopsis

```
bil [options] my_file
```

If `my_file` is provided, Bil computes the solution of the problem described in that input file.
Without any argument, the list of available options is displayed:

```bash
bil
```

## Input file

The file `my_file` provides the input data for the problem to be solved. A list of **reserved keywords** (with an upper-case first letter) organizes the data into several groups: mesh, material properties, boundary conditions, etc.

### Example input file

The following example illustrates a drainage problem for a 1 m sand column governed by Richards' equation. The column is initially saturated with liquid pressure $p_l = p_{atm} - g(x-1)$. At $t = 0$, the column is drained from the bottom by imposing $p_l = p_{atm}$.

## Output files

Each run produces **two sets of output files**.

### Point files `.pi` — results at points

`my_file.pi` where `i` ranges from 1 to the number of points defined by `Points`.
These files give the results at the specified points. The first column contains the times; other columns contain the model quantities.

### Date files `.ti` — results at dates

`my_file.ti` where `i` ranges from 0 to the number of dates defined by `Dates`.
The first three columns contain the node coordinates. The following columns contain the same quantities as in the `.pi` files.

> Lines commented with `#` in the first column indicate the nature of the computed quantities.

## Other files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `my_file.ti` | Results at date index `i` |
| `my_file.pi` | Results at point index `i` |
| `my_file.posi` | View `i` readable by Gmsh |
| `my_file.msh` | Gmsh mesh file |
| `my_file.graph` | Mesh graph |
| `my_file.graph.iperm` | Inverse permutations file |
| `my_file.sto` | Storage file |
| `my_file.cont` | Continuation file (without re-initialization) |
| `my_file.conti` | Continuation file (with re-initialization) |

### Resuming a calculation

- **`.cont`**: restart without executing the initialization step — the calculation continues as if there had been no interruption.
- **`.conti`**: restart with re-initialization — some variables can be reset (e.g. strain variables).

**Procedure:**

1. Copy `old_file.sto` to `new_file.cont` (or `.conti`)
2. Create `new_file` with additional dates beyond the last date of the previous run
3. Run `bil new_file`

## Calculation options

### Node renumbering

```bash
bil -iperm my_file
```

Generates `my_file.graph.iperm` with the inverse node permutation (HSL_MC40 method).

!!! warning "Important for 2D/3D problems"
    Run renumbering **before** the calculation for any 2D or 3D problem:

    ```bash
    bil -iperm my_file    # generates my_file.graph.iperm
    bil my_file           # calculation with optimized mesh
    ```

    For multi-frontal solvers (SuperLU, MA38) or Krylov space methods (PETSc), this file is not needed.

### Solver selection

```bash
bil -solver method my_file
```

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `crout` | Crout method (default) |
| `superlu` | Sequential SuperLU (requires `libsuperlu.so`) |
| `superlumt` | Multi-threaded SuperLU (option `-nthreads N`) |
| `superludist` | Distributed SuperLU |
| `ma38` | HSL MA38 (requires `libblas.so`) |
| `petscksp` | PETSc KSP solver (requires `libpetsc.so`) |

**Multi-threaded SuperLU:**

```bash
bil -solver superlumt -nthreads 4 my_file
```

**PETSc KSP:**

```bash
bil -solver petscksp -ksp_type gmres -pc_type ilu my_file
```

### Resolution module

```bash
bil -with "Monolithic N" my_file   # N = number of time solutions kept in memory (default 2)
bil -with "SNIA N" my_file         # Sequential non-iterative approach
```

## Post-processing options

```bash
bil -post GmshParsed my_file   # generates .posi files in Gmsh parsed format
bil -post GmshASCII  my_file   # generates .posi files in Gmsh ASCII format
```
