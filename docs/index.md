# Bil — Documentation

**Bil** is an open-source software framework based on finite element/volume methods, designed for the simulation of coupled phenomena in continuum mechanics, geomechanics, environmental engineering, and materials science. Bil is distributed under the [GNU General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) (GPL v3).

Bil is written in C/C++ and can run on any OS with a C++ compiler installed (Linux, macOS, Windows).

## General overview

Bil adopts a **plugin architecture in C** that strictly separates the generic computation core (solvers, assembly, I/O) from physical constitutive models. Each physical model is an independent plugin implementing the interface contract defined by the `Model_t` structure.

This design makes it possible to:

- develop new models without modifying the framework
- combine different physics (hydro-mechanical, thermo-chemical couplings, …)
- work with 1D, 2D, and 3D meshes using finite element (FEM) and finite volume (FVM) discretizations

Bil does not include a mesh generator or a built-in post-processing tool. It relies on:

- **[Gmsh](https://gmsh.info)** — mesh generation (`.msh` files) and post-processing (`.posi` files)
- **[Gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info)** — plotting 1D results (`.ti`, `.pi` files)

## Application domains

| Domain | Available models |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Flow** | Richards equation (1D/2D), second Fick's law, two-phase liquid-gas flow |
| **Mechanics** | Elasticity, elasticity with damage, hardening plasticity (Drucker-Prager, Cam-Clay, BBM) |
| **Poromechanics** | Biot's poroelasticity, poroplasticity |
| **Phase change** | Freeze-thaw in concrete and soils (1D, 2D, 3D) |
| **Durability & chemistry** | Carbonation, chloride ingress, sulfate attack, acid attack |
| **Coupled transfers** | Drying-wetting-salt, unsaturated soils |
| **Specialized** | Multi-scale mechanics by FEM² |

## Quick installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dangla/bil.git
cd bil

# Compile
make

# Run a calculation
bil -iperm my_file     # node renumbering (bandwidth optimization)
bil my_file            # run the calculation
```

!!! tip
    The `-iperm` option (Cuthill-McKee renumbering) should be run **before** the calculation
    to optimize matrix bandwidth when using Crout factorization. Not needed for multi-frontal
    (SuperLU, MA38) or Krylov space (PETSc) solvers.
